- removed mod_include-segv patch (this bug is fixed in apache 1.3.22)
- removed lang(en) from *.html.html and main index.html.en (treat them as
  "C locale"), fixed some other lang() marks
- apxs-quiet patch: by default successful apxs -e operations are quiet
  (without commands echo), can be turned off by new -v (like "verbose") option
